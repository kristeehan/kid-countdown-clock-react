# Kid Countdown Clock

This project displays a circle that turns from green to red based on an amount of time (defaults to 5 minutes). This is useful for children who are more visual and understand something they can see rather than something verbal like "five more minutes until bed".

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Configuration

You can configure the countdown time by changing the `DEFAULT_CLOCK_TIME` constant in the `src/constants.ts` file. The default value is 5 minutes. This can also be changed in the settings route.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the application in the `build` directory.
